### Here is the code repo for our paper: Leveraging attention-based deep neural networks for security vetting of Android applications (EAI Transactions 2021)

Before reading the code, you may see the above paper for high-level details on the experiments whose code are available here.

The raw apps and artifacts datasets are not included here due to the size constraint. They are available upon request.
